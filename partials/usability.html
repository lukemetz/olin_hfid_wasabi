  <h2>Usability study: Determining the most intuitive homepage design</h2>


  <h3>Testing hypothesis:</h3>
  <p>Users will be able to correctly navigate to room selection page more quickly when they are given the option to either specify the room they would like to reserve or browse available rooms. </p>
  <h4>Protocol: Participant selection</h4>
  <p>Ideally, the study would have greater than forty participants who were familiar with room reservation systems but had not seen any previous iterations of this design. Users would have a minimal level of technical proficiency of as assessed by a standard computer literacy survey. Users would be divided into two groups (balanced for age and gender) with each group being presented a different task.</p>

  <h4>Protocol: Reservation tasks</h4>
  <p>Users will be provided with one of two randomly selected example tasks that requires them to utilize filtering functions to select a room or utilize the calendar function to select a time. Each user will randomly be presented with a version of the homepage which either contains two buttons ("I have a room" and "Help me find a room") or a text field to specify a room or a button to browse available rooms. The test administrator will record how many seconds it takes the user to complete the task (completion time). If a user initially navigates to the incorrect page, the tester will also note the time required to correct the path and navigate to the correct page (correction time). The user will then be presented with the alternate version of the home page and ask to complete the same task again with the completion and correction times recorded again. The tester will then ask which of the two interfaces was preferred. If the user completed both tasks without navigating to the correct page, they will not be asked to rate the home pages.</p>

  <h4>Limitations of the study</h4>
  <p>The tasks used in this study attempt to correlate with typical user interactions with reservation system, based on user interviews in a previous phase of the design. However, in order to limit the number of dimensions to interpret in our results, they do not cover all the usage modes. Notably, we do not assess usability for recurring events. However, we have not currently found that users schedule recurring meetings have a mental mental that varies substantially from those presented in our basic tasks.</p>

  <p>Since our study consists of a small sample and people we have specifically chosen, our results will not be definitive. Meaning that even though, for example, that our testers may have had better results with one interface that might not mean much. There is always the possibility that our testers happen to react well. We would need a representative sample in order to obtain conclusive and definitive results. However we know that we are unable to obtain a representative sample due to the classroom and academic environment.</p>

  <h4>Results</h4>


  <table border="1px">
    <tr>
      <th>User #</th>
      <th>First page seen</th>
      <th>Time on first page</th>
      <th>Time on second page</th>
      <th>Preference</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Two buttons</td>
      <td>6.2 sec</td>
      <td>3 sec</td>
      <td>Two buttons</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>One text field</td>
      <td>4.2 sec</td>
      <td>3 sec</td>
      <td>One text field, but would like the button to say “Help me find a room,” like the other page</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <p>The main factors we are looking for when parsing our results are differences in time spent on the page between the two different homepage designs. While statistically insignificant, our two data points suggest that the “one text field” design provides a faster interface to our site. This is shown in the time spent on the first page record.
  One interesting trend that our data suggests is that the user’s preference is not being correlated to the relative time on page. If this were to be the case with all of our data, we would probably end up choosing the the homepage based off of the common quantitative preference. It is not, however, our goal to create a system that works incredibly fast but to create a system that people like and find easy to learn.</p>

  <h4>Site Modifications</h4>
  <p>Assuming the trends discussed in the above section did turn out to be true, we would shift our site to use the one text field input. If given time, we would like to take this one text field input and test variations on it. These could include wording on buttons as well as locations of buttons.</p>
