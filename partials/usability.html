  <h2>Usability study: Determining the most intuitive homepage design</h2>


  <h3>Testing hypothesis:</h3>
  <p>Users will be able to correctly navigate to room selection page more quickly when they are given the option to either specify the room they would like to reserve or browse available rooms. </p>
  <h4>Protocol: Participant selection</h4>
  <p>Ideally, the study would have greater than forty participants who were familiar with room reservation systems but had not seen any previous iterations of this design. Users would have a minimal level of technical proficiency of as assessed by a standard computer literacy survey. Users would be divided into two groups (balanced for age and gender) with each group being presented a different task.</p>

  <h4>Protocol: Reservation tasks</h4>
  <p>Users will be provided with one of two randomly selected example tasks that requires them to utilize filtering functions to select a room or utilize the calendar function to select a time. Each user will randomly be presented with a version of the homepage which either contains two buttons ("I have a room" and "Help me find a room") or a text field to specify a room or a button to browse available rooms. The test administrator will record how many seconds it takes the user to complete the task (completion time). If a user initially navigates to the incorrect page, the tester will also note the time required to correct the path and navigate to the correct page (correction time). The user will then be presented with the alternate version of the home page and ask to complete the same task again with the completion and correction times recorded again. The tester will then ask which of the two interfaces was preferred. If the user completed both tasks without navigating to the correct page, they will not be asked to rate the home pages.</p>

  <h4>Limitations of the study</h4>
  <p>The tasks used in this study attempt to correlate with typical user interactions with reservation system, based on user interviews in a previous phase of the design. However, in order to limit the number of dimensions to interpret in our results, they do not cover all the usage modes. Notably, we do not assess usability for recurring events. However, we have not currently found that users schedule recurring meetings have a mental mental that varies substantially from those presented in our basic tasks.</p>

  <p>Since our study consists of a small sample and people we have specifically chosen, our results will not be definitive. Meaning that even though, for example, that our testers may have had better results with one interface that might not mean much. There is always the possibility that our testers happen to react well. We would need a representative sample in order to obtain conclusive and definitive results. However we know that we are unable to obtain a representative sample due to the classroom and academic environment.</p>
